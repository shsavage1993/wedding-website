						<li>
							Red plays a vital role in Chinese weddings, as it is
							associated with success, loyalty, honor, fertility,
							and love, amongst others. Because of this,
							decorations at Chinese weddings are generally in
							red, and so is the bride's dress.
						</li>
						<li>
							Before a Chinese wedding celebration, the groom will
							often go to the bride's house to collect her. The
							bride will be surrounded by a few of her
							girlfriends, who will have to be bribed or convinced
							before they will hand over the bride. Then, the
							bride and groom will bow to the bride's parents
							before going to the groom's house.
						</li>
						<li>
							The tea ceremony is to honour parents and always
							begins with prayer. The couple kneels on tea pillows
							facing the parents and take turns serving tea to
							each set of parents.
						</li>
						<li>
							Decorations in the hall will usually involve Âõç the
							"double joy" character, reserved solely for
							matrimonial usage. Banners with wishes in various
							different phrases will also be hung on the doors and
							windows of the venue in order to wish the new couple
							well.
						</li>
						<li>
							Visitors to the wedding will usually give a red
							envelope with money to the bride and groom. Make
							sure not to put anything in multiples of four, as
							four is an unlucky number in Chinese tradition.
						</li>
